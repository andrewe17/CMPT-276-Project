# Ninja-Dash Developing progress

A user will be able to login, play the game, and view their profile to track their stats. The game itself is in 2D birdâ€™s eye view. Players of up to 5 are placed in a map based on real cities where they fight until the last person standing wins. Basic controls include movement (up, down, left, right), dashing and attacking using weapons picked up from the map. The map will consist of obstacles where players can turn invisible (for a period of time) and implement a weather API to change the map settings depending on real-time weather. The weather will affect game settings and player abilities and the API for this function will probably be weather.com.
